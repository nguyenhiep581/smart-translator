- Prod build: `make build`; multi-entry Vite build (background/content/etc.).
- Package zip: `make zip` (creates smart-translator.zip from dist/).
- Format: `make format` or `pnpm run format`; check-only `make format-check`.
- Lint: `make lint` or `pnpm run lint`; autofix `make lint-fix` or `pnpm run lint:fix`.

- Pre-commit hook dry-run: `make pre-commit` or `pnpm exec lint-staged`.
- Clean: `make clean` (removes dist, node_modules, zip) — ensure reinstall afterwards.
